JNCryptor for Android 

This is a fork of the code found at https://code.google.com/p/jncryptor by dun...@worthread.com (https://code.google.com/u/109998297732361046449/)

The code is modified to work on Android earlier than Gingerbread and compatible upwards, starting from Android SDK 7 with the aid of using SpongyCastle.

The project is Eclipse compatible and compilable.

The following libraries are required:

 - commons-io-2.4.jar (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)
 - commons-lang3-3.1.jar (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/)
 - sc-light-jdk15on-1.47.02 (http://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/)
 - scprov-jdk15on-1.47.02 (http://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/)
 - slf4j-api-1.7.2.jar (https://code.google.com/p/jncryptor)
